Game of Life written in Rust to learn the language.

## Usage

The functionality is pretty basic, it takes an input file with the definition of the starting grid. Examples can be found in *inputs*.
Once the program is running and the starting grid is shown, three actions are possible:

* Exit the program, pressing *q*
* Save the current state pressing *s*
* Run an iteration pressing any other key.
